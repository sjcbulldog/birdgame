The game is played with four players.  Players across from one another are partners.
The game is played to 500 points playing consecutive hands until one or both teams scores over 500 points.
If both teams score over 500 points, the team with the highest score wins.
The card deck is 42 cards.
The cards are red cards 5 - 14, black cards 5 - 14, green cards 5 - 14, and yellow cards 5 - 14.  In addition there is a bird card and a red one.
The cards are dealt with nine to each player, and six in the middle face down except the top card which is face up.
The deal moves around the table clockwise from hand to hand.
The five cards are worth 5 point.  The 10 card is worth 10 points.  The 14 card is worth 10 points, and bird card worth 20 points, and the red one is worth 30 points.
The player to the left of the dealer bids first.
Each player bids on the number of points they think they can make and the bidding goes around the table until there are three players that have passed.
A player may bid pass when the no longer want to bid.
A player may bid check when to bid would require them to outbid their partner, but they may want to bid again in the future.
Once three bidders have passed, the remaining bidder with the high bid, get the six cards in the middle of the table.
The winning bidder makes a hand of nine cards out of the fifteen total, their original 9 plus the 6 from the middle.
They declare a trump suit.
The game is played as a series of tricks, where a trick is a sequence of four cards played by four players.
From there the winning bidder leads a card to start the first trick.
All other players must follow the color of the lead card.
Note the bird card and the red one are not considered part of any fixed color, but rather are considered part of the trump color.
If no trumps are played or if trumps were the first card played, the high card wins the trick.
The bird card is considered a trump card higher than the 14.
The red one card is considered a trump card higher than the bird card.
If a card other than a trump card is the first card played, but a player has none of the color that was played first, they may elect to play a trump card.  In this case the highest trump card played wins the trick.
A five in any suit is worth 5 points.  
A 10 in any suit is worth 10 points.  
A 14 in any suit is worth 10 points.
The bird card is worth 20 points.
The red one is worth 30 points.
A team gets the points from each trick they win.
The points are totaled at the end of each hand.
If the team that took the centerPile does not reach their bid, they go backward their bid amount.
