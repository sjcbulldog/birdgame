# Done 
Update the valid time for the bidWinnerMessageTime to be between 10 and 10000.

Add a display to the home page showing all user names that are logged in.  This should be a vertical list just to the left of the tables display.  It should be below the header, left of an parallel with the tables.

Add a user dialog that is accessible to admin users via the hamburger menu.  The user dialog lists all users, has a search input to show only those users whose name, username, or email matches the text types, and allow the userType to be switched to admin, pending, normal, or banned.  If a user state is banned and they try to log in, show a message that they have been banned from the site.

When a user logs out of the site, they should be removed from the Logged In Users list.

Add an watchers view.  It is basically the same as the game view, but the user cannot interact with the game at all.  All cards in player's hands are shown face down (so only see card backs), and the watcher can see cards as their played for a trick with the same trick delay, won trick animation, etc.  The leave button takes a watcher back to the home screen and removes the player as a watcher for that table.

Actually when entering a user name in the Create Account form, dynamically check the backend on each character typed and if the user name is in use, display an error message stating that user name is already in use.

Error structure: {
  "headers": {
    "normalizedNames": {},
    "lazyUpdate": null
  },
  "status": 409,
  "statusText": "Conflict",
  "url": "http://192.168.1.35:3000/auth/register",
  "ok": false,
  "name": "HttpErrorResponse",
  "message": "Http failure response for http://192.168.1.35:3000/auth/register: 409 Conflict",
  "error": {
    "message": "Email already exists",
    "error": "Conflict",
    "statusCode": 409
  }
}

In the registration form, when the user is typing a user name, if the number of characters typed is less than 8 show an error saying the user name must be eight characters.  

In the Create Account form, if the user moves focus away from the Username field, check the backend to see if that user name is already in use.  If it is, show an error below the username field stating that the given username is taken.

In the preferences dialog, if the total number of tables is changed and is made smaller, display a popup stating that this may disrupt the game of any players at tables that will be removed.  Also, remove the Note: Changing tables count ... in the dialog.

When the login form is displayed, set the focus to the username field.

When the user refreshes the browser while playing a game, the user switches to watcher mode.  The watcher mode should be part of the game state for a given user and therefore also get refreshed when the browser is refereshed. Also, When the game view is in watcher mode, the player names should reflect the players playing the game and not the watcher.

When playing in the game view, in the lower left corner there is an indicator of the color or trumps as well as the team that took the bid and for how much.  When drawing this, underline the one of the two names in the team that took the bid with the specific player that won the bid.

When the red one is led, it is the trump color and any card of the trump color should be legal for the human player to play.  When the red one is lead, the color red is not the color being led unless red is trumps.

When it comes time for a human player to bid, if his partner has checked and both opposing players have passed, that human player should be skipped and retain their current bid status and the bidding process should move to their partner.  Their partner can either raise the bid or pass at this point.

In the game view, In the lower left corner we made a change to underline the actual player that took the bid.  However, the underline is not really noticible.  Find another way to indentify which of the two players actually took the bid.

When the AI takes the bid and is playing the hand, they should save a trump for the last trick unless they are sure there are no points in the discarded six cards.

When AI is playing and their partner took the bid, if their partner leads a trump that is not the highest trump still outstanding, do not put points on the trick if possible.

# In Progress

Create a mobile site for cell phones.  For the home page, do not show the list of players logged into the site and show the tables vertically one below another.  The tables show have the same look but should be scaled about 25% smaller so a single table will fit on the cell phone screen.
